      title = "Deep Learning"
      description = "It is a new field in machine learning research, and its concept is derived from the study of neural networks. In the field of computer vision, image processing and other fields have great potential for development. Deep learning methods are used to simulate how the human brain thinks, mimicking the mechanisms of the human brain to interpret data such as images, sounds, and text. Taking images as an example, by combining low-level image features, the concepts of intermediate edges, shapes, and the like are developed, and then higher-level meanings, such as objects or faces, are learned."

      title = "Incorporating attack information into makeup to attack deep learning models"
      description = "Machine learning has evolved very rapidly, with good results in both computer vision and natural language processing. There are many deep learning techniques that are used in everyday life of humans such as autonomous vehicles and face recognition systems. Nowadays, the gradual dependence of human daily life on deep neural networks can lead to serious consequences, so the security of neural networks becomes very important. Therefore, the deep neural network has obvious weaknesses. We propose a method based on generating a confrontation network to generate a facial makeup picture that can deceive the face recognition system. We hide the perturbation of the attack in the results of the abnormal makeup photos that humans can't detect. The experimental results show that we can not only generate high-quality facial makeup images, but also our attack results have a high attack success rate in the face recognition system."

      description = "The music rhythm game is currently a very popular game, and we propose to generate a music rhythm game spectrum based on the method of Generative Adversarial Network. The music is separated into two parts: the vocal and the soundtrack, which makes the generated spectrum closer to the real spectrum. The model consists of two concepts of Generative Adversarial Network: Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets (CGANs) for music information and Improved Wasserstein GAN (WGAN-GP) for better convergence of the model.

      title = "Be an Artist! Scribble Lines to Painting."
      description = "We propose a fully automated system that converts random graffiti into a painting. However, this is a serious challenge because the input graffiti can be very messy and hide multiple objects, so finding the correlation between these repeated lines and multiple objects is not a simple matter. In the system, we use selective search, sparse coding and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), in which we use selective search to find the part of the object that may be the object of the graffiti; then use sparse coding to find the corresponding element; CNN sets the style to be converted. The final experimental results show that the methods we use have superior performance and produce artistic works."

      title = "Motion recognition based on deep learning"
      description = "With the popularity of wearable devices in recent years, the application of motion recognition through the sensing it collects has become more and more important. In the field of computer vision, human motion recognition is becoming more and more important. In motion recognition, a large number of sensing data collected by multi-axis wear devices are also used to perform motion recognition. Deep learning is seen as the most promising way to solve many computer vision problems in machine learning. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is one of the most concerned methods in deep learning. We propose the architecture of MP-CNN, which contains two new components of D-CNN and S-CNN to identify the motion data. In D-CNN, we use GMM to get each in the training phase. The distribution of actions, then the GLR and GMMs are used to partition the input signal data and channel calibration, and each input information is mapped to the corresponding CNN channel. Therefore, we also propose an LZW-based S-CNN architecture that uses CNN to construct the relationship between state, input information and transition probability to automatically convert the sensed data to state transition probability. Finally, D-CNN and S-CNN are combined into MP-CNN to improve the overall architecture performance."

For the store, if you can collect the relevant clothing styles of the customers, you can adjust the purchase styles and the furnishings in the store according to this information, further recommend the related accessories to consumers according to the preferences of consumers and save consumers to find matching accessories. time. For garment manufacturers, they can analyze the data collected by various stores to know which styles are popular and those styles are unpopular, and thus become the next batch of new style design references.

      description = "Nowadays, the society is gradually moving towards aging, and the health care of the silver-haired people is an issue that everyone values. We plan to focus on the rehabilitation and entertainment of the silver-haired people. We hope to further analyze the movements of the silver-haired people using rehabilitation props or exercise equipment by analyzing the interaction between people and objects. The first is to measure the correctness of the operation and expect to achieve the purpose and function of the rehabilitation exercise. Analysis of the use of rehabilitation sports equipment, the system has the opportunity to raise warnings or provide correct posture voice prompts to achieve the desired effect of rehabilitation sports; the second is to provide user feedback through the results of the analysis, such as high or low scores, tasks achieved or Voice encouragement, transforming rehabilitation sports into a more entertaining way, adding the fun of the Yinfa people to the rehabilitation exercise, extending the time of the user's rehabilitation activities, further motivating the patients to be correct and happy to use rehabilitation facilities."

      description = "The goal of this project is to compare low-resolution face images to verify that they are the same person. In today's unrestricted environment, the effectiveness of face recognition often decreases due to posture factors, so we establish a normalization method to restore any face angle, thereby returning the face angle of any state to increase The effectiveness of face recognition. The project uses two Caffe model architectures: Matching-Convolutional NeuralNetwork (M-CNN) and Siamese Neural Network (SNN). Finally, the accuracy of the SNN model is more than 90%, which is higher than that of M-CNN. "

The performance of sparse coding depends on the quality of the dictionary. If you can learn a good dictionary, the performance of sparse coding will naturally be good. The research direction of Our laboratory for massive data is sparse coding representation of huge data and sparse coding dictionary learning of huge data."
